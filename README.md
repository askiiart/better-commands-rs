# better-commands

A better way of running commands.

`better-commands` allows you to run commands with both `stdout` and `stderr` properly, with command duration and timestamps for each line built-in.

## TODO

- Improve docs
- Add `Fn`/`FnOnce`/whatever for what code to run in the `stdout`/`stderr` loops, similar to `.map()`
