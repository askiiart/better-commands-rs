# better-commands

A better way of running commands - get stdout and stderr together, in order with timestamps, while easily running code as the command runs line-by-line.

## TODO

- Improve docs
- Add `Fn`/`FnOnce`/whatever for what code to run in the `stdout`/`stderr` loops, similar to `.map()`
- Add tests
